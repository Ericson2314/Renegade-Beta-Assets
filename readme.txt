So now that we have the SDK we all have been begging for, there should be some big project to commemorate the occasion and kick of a revival of the fan projects scene. How about a Tiberian Dawn mod package for APB?

a short Q&A:

	Q: Why Westwood3D?
	A: Because everything else around here is. There are also similar projects on other engines.

	Q: Why build it off APB and not Renegade?
	A: Well, both games do now use roughly the same engine version now. But APB's presets have been cleaned up, greatly. The number of TD presets in Renegade would in fact make rigging a TD mod more confusing.

	Q: Why now?
	A: Because this is the first time we have had compatible mod tools since the presets were cleaned up. Also, the new string and object database editors should make this type of stuff much less error-prone. If anybody can rig up a patching system for those databases (not sure the temps database is acquitted), that would make supporting APB updates unbelievably easier.

	Q: Why won't this fail like all the other attempts?
	A: I can't guarantee anything, but rather than start with modeling (the fun stuff), I go straight to rigging. There is already enough abandoned assets to do that. Also, I will host everything on Github, so even if it goes under, the work will live for posterity.

	Q: Why a poll?
	A: To see if there is enough interest to get this working.
