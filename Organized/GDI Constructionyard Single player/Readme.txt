This is the GDI single player contruction yard created by Westwood.

You should use the Old interior if you want to use the constructionyard elevator.

This has a hole in the main contructionyard area. Which supposebly used to carry vehicles.
The rest of the assets in this folder are basically all the standard GDI Constructionyard parts.
