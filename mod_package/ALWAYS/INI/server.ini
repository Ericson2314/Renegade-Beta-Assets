;
;  Each slave server must have it's own login information and serial number.
;  Each slave server can have it's own game settings, seperate from the master.

;
; Renegade Master Server settings.
;
; This section contains the settings for the Master Renegade Server.

[Server]

; Config =
;
;  This specifies the location of the game settings file used by the master
;  server. You can change this to point to any Renegade server settings .ini
;  file or change the default .ini file to reflect the game settings you would
;  like for your server.

Config = svrcfg_cnc.ini


; GameType =
;
;  Set this to WOL for a Westwood Online dedicated server.
;  Set this to GameSpy for a GameSpy mode dedicated server.
;  Set this to LAN for a LAN mode dedicated server.
;

GameType = WOL


; Nickname =
;
;  This is the Westwood Online nickname you will use when logging into the
;  Westwood Online matchmaking system. You can use a nickname from a previous
;  Westwood Studios game or apply for a new one by copying the following line
;  and pasting it into your web browsers address window
;
;     http://games2.westwood.com/cgi-bin/cgiclient?ren_reg2&request=expand_template&Template=newreg_menu.html&LANGCODE=0

Nickname = WESTWOOD


;
; Password =
;
;  This is the password that matches the nickname used above.

Password = WESTWOOD


; Serial =
;
;  The serial number that you specified when installing the Renegade Dedicated
;  Server.

Serial = WESTWOOD

; LoginServer =
;
;  This field can be used to specify the Westwood Online matchmaking server
;  to connect to. If left blank, the Renegade Server will connect to the
;  closest matchmaking server. To specify a server to connect to, use one of
;  the names listed above in the section 'Available Westwood Servers'.

LoginServer =


; Port =
;
;  This is the UDP port that the Renegade Dedicated Server will use to
;  communicate with game clients. This should normally be left at 0 and the
;  Server will decide for itself what port to use. This should work with most
;  firewalls and NAT connections but, if you need to manually set a port, you
;  can do it here.

Port = 0


; GameSpyGamePort =
;
;  This is the UDP port that the Renegade Dedicated Server will use to
;  communicate with game clients, while running as a GameSpy Server.  When running
;  as a GameSpy server this port value will be used instead of the above Port value.
;  The default value is 4848.

GameSpyGamePort = 0


; GameSpyQueryPort =
;
;  This is the UDP port that the Renegade Dedicated Server will use to
;  communicate with the GameSpy Master Server and GameSpy clients. The default
;  value is 25300.  If this port is in use Renegade will find another port
;  to use instead(25301, 25302, ...).

GameSpyQueryPort = 0


; BandwidthUp =
;
;  If you know how much bandwidth you want to allocate for the Renegade
;  Server to use then you can specify it here. A minimum of 60k bits per second
;  is recommended for each client you plan to connect to. If you leave this
;  value as 0 (the default) then the available bandwidth will be automatically
;  detected(WOL only). Some guidelines follow.
;
;         Set to 1500000 for a 32 player game
;         Set to  750000 for a 16 player game
;         Set to  250000 for an 8 player game
;
;  Make sure you don't set the Bandwidth number to be higher than your
;  actual available bandwidth or gameplay performance will be poor.

BandwidthUp = 0

; NetUpdateRate = 
;
;  Set this to control the frequency of network updates sent to clients.  This
;  is the number of updates sent per second.  Higher values increase network
;  traffic, lower values decrease traffic.  Valid values must be in the 5 - 30
;  range.  As you increase NetUpdateRate the values set for BandwidthUp must 
;  also scale accordingly.  The default is 8.

NetUpdateRate = 8


; AllowRemoteAdmin =
;
;  Set this to true to enable remote server administration via the RenRem
;  tool. You must also set a password for remote administration to be
;  allowed.
;  Slave servers inherit this setting from the master.

AllowRemoteAdmin = false


; RemoteAdminPassword =
;
;  This is the password required to connect to a server with the RenRem
;  admin too.
;  Slave servers inherit this setting from the master.

RemoteAdminPassword =


; RemoteAdminIp =
;
;  This is the ip that the remote administration service will listen for 
;  incoming request on.  The default is to listen on ALL ip addresses.  If
;  you have an internal ip address and only want to administer internally
;  set this to your internal ip address.
;

RemoteAdminIP =


; RemoteAdminPort =
;
;  The port to connect to for remote administration.
;  This can be set per slave. The default slave ports will be shown when
;  connecting to the master with the RenRem tool.

; Renegade Slave Server settings.
;
; These sections contain the settings for the Renegade Slave Servers. Each
; additional server you want to run can be configured seperately by modifying
; the corresponding section below.
;
; The settings for a slave server are the same as for a master with the
; exception of the 'enable' flag. Setting Enable = 1 will enable the given
; Slave Server. The Slave Server will start automatically at the same time
; as the Master Renegade Server.
;
; Each Slave Server must have it's own login name, password & serial number.
