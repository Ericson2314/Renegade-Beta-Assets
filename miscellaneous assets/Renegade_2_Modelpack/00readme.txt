Contained in this zip file are some miscellaneous models that we thought 
might be fun for the Renegade mod community to play with.  
Some of the models are un-finished and some may need to be re-textured 
but I think you'll find it worth the effort :-)

Notes:
- Some (maybe all) of the trees have emitters in them for the knock-down 
effects that aren't present in Renegade.  Just remove the emitters from 
them and you have some nice tree models for your maps.

- The destructable base wall animation did not translate into gmax.  I've 
included the max file so you get the idea of how it worked and you can 
just use the w3d file as-is.

- The vehicles were textured with a new version of the w3d tools that 
don't work with Renegade so you'll need to re-apply the textures.  
These are some very nice models!
