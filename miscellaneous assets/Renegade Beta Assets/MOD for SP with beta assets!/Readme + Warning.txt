This is a small mod I made for Singleplayer Renegade to play it with a beta feeling with it.

WARNING:
This is not a finished product and can be unstable!
For some it might not even be playable yet.

If you want to play this you will need to move the following files to your Renegade data directory ->
- All files in Logan\Editorchache
- Objects.ddb from Logan\Presets (Warning! Remove the objects.ddb before you go to an online game otherwise you cannot join any server!)
- All the m0*.ldd files from Logan\Levels

Leveleditor files:
Just copy the entire Logan folder to your leveleditor folder

You may alter anything for your own purposes.
However if you want to continue the project you may though keep crediting me.
So yes you can release your own version. (if you credit me ;) )
