This is a pack containing certain beta models which some of them haven't been released publically. 
Most of the beta assets are remakes by myself or by other people.
I will credit them(See readme's supplied in the models folder). 

-= You may use every model according to the liscence that is added with it.=-

This pack might not be complete some people may have other assets.
Please send them to me so I can update this pack so everyone can benefit from them.
If I did forget to credit someone please contact me. 

The purpose of this pack is that everyone can enjoy assets from the Beta Renegade.
Without having to look all over the internet.

Most of the models have the source files supplied with them and also preview/concept screenshots.
You can use these to edit them. If you want to release your conversion, please credit the owner!
